## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10 or later
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- (Optional) [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/) for potentially faster downloads

## Installation (Windows)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Uranite/yt-dlp-config.git
   cd yt-dlp-config
   ```

2. Install yt-dlp (nightly):
   ```bash
   pip install -U --pre "yt-dlp[default]"
   ```

## Quick Start

### For Channel Archival
